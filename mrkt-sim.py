"""

This file will contain the simulation code. There will be a simulator class, structured below.
The simulation will run the backtest considering all parameters provided by the user.
After the simulation is run performance metrics will be calculated.
Those metrics will be returned to the user using data visualization techniques

# Market Sim Class

    # def __init__(self):
    # Constructor function
    # Will hold initial data and set desired simulation values / situations

    # def backtest(simulation params):
    # simulation will run with all sim params considered, including scenarios and initial data
    # after simulation is run, it will call the performance metrics to be displayed

    # def calculate_preformance_metrics(self, all metrics from backtest, preformance benchmark)
    # will calculate preformance benchmarks to prepare results to be displayed
    # once all calculated the results will be passed to be displayed
